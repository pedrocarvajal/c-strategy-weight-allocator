# Work in progress

Objective: build a semaphore to enable and disable strategies inside a portfolio. Problem: if you have more than 10 strategies in a portfolio, you will face problems about minimum lot size rules. So my objective is to have 100+ strategies coexisting in a portfolio and just using the best ones every day, with a smart way to select those strategies (i.e. k-means, ML models based on market regimes, etc.).
